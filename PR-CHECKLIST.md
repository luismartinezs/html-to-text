# Before Merging PR Checklist

Complete all items before merging any pull request to maintain code quality and documentation consistency.

## 1. Investigate Branch Changes

### 1.1 Review Commit History
- [ ] Run `git log --oneline --graph main..HEAD` to see all commits in this branch
- [ ] Run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` to see file changes summary
- [ ] Review each commit for:
  - [ ] Clear, descriptive commit messages
  - [ ] Logical code organization
  - [ ] No sensitive information (keys, passwords, etc.)

### 1.2 Analyze Code Changes
- [ ] Run `git diff main...HEAD` to review all code changes
- [ ] Verify changes align with PR description/requirements
- [ ] Check for:
  - [ ] New functions/exports that need documentation
  - [ ] Changed function signatures
  - [ ] New dependencies added
  - [ ] Breaking changes to existing API

## 2. Update Documentation Files

### 2.1 Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Add new version entry with current date
- [ ] Format: `## [x.x.x] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- [ ] Document all user-facing changes:
  - [ ] New features (start with "feat:")
  - [ ] Bug fixes (start with "fix:")
  - [ ] Breaking changes (clearly marked)
  - [ ] Dependencies updates if user-impacting

### 2.2 Update package.json
Check if any of these need updating:
- [ ] **Version number** - bump according to semver:
  - Major: Breaking changes
  - Minor: New features (backward compatible)
  - Patch: Bug fixes
- [ ] **Exports field** - if new functions/modules added
- [ ] **Dependencies** - if new packages were added
- [ ] **Scripts** - if new build/test commands added
- [ ] **Types field** - if TypeScript definitions changed

### 2.3 Update CLAUDE.md (Following Best Practices)
Update only if changes affect development workflow:
- [ ] **Bash commands** - new build/test/lint commands
- [ ] **Code style** - new patterns or conventions introduced
- [ ] **Core files** - new important files added to project
- [ ] **Testing** - new test approaches or frameworks
- [ ] **Workflow** - changes to development process
- [ ] **Build system** - modifications to build outputs or process

**CLAUDE.md Best Practices:**
- [ ] Keep concise and human-readable
- [ ] Focus on project-specific context Claude needs
- [ ] Use clear command examples with descriptions
- [ ] Avoid duplicating information available elsewhere

### 2.4 Update README.md
- [ ] **Installation** - verify instructions are current
- [ ] **Usage examples** - add examples for new features
- [ ] **API documentation** - document new exported functions
- [ ] **Import syntax** - show how to import new functions
- [ ] **Breaking changes** - update examples if API changed

## 3. Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Code Quality
- [ ] Run `bun run lint:scripts` - no lint errors
- [ ] Run `bun run typecheck` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `bun test` - all tests pass
- [ ] Run `bun run test:coverage` - coverage meets project standards

### 3.2 Build Verification
- [ ] Run `bun run build` - successful build
- [ ] Verify build outputs in `build/dist/`:
  - [ ] ESM bundle (`html-to-text.js`)
  - [ ] IIFE bundle (`html-to-text.iife.js`)
  - [ ] Type definitions (`index.d.ts`)
- [ ] Check `build/package.json` has correct exports configuration

### 3.3 Final Review
- [ ] All new code follows project conventions (ES modules, TypeScript strict mode)
- [ ] No TODO comments left in code
- [ ] No debugging console.log statements
- [ ] Git status is clean (no untracked files)

## 4. Pre-Merge Actions

### 4.1 Documentation Review
- [ ] All documentation changes are accurate
- [ ] Examples in README work with current API
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry is complete and clear
- [ ] Version numbers are consistent across files

### 4.2 Final Checks
- [ ] PR title follows conventional commits format
- [ ] PR description explains changes clearly
- [ ] All CI checks are passing
- [ ] Code review feedback has been addressed
