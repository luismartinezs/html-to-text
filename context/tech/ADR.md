# Architecture Decision Record

## Decision: Use parse5 for HTML Parsing

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Our HTML-to-text conversion library needs a reliable method to parse HTML documents and extract meaningful text content. The core challenge is handling malformed HTML, nested structures, and various edge cases while maintaining security and performance.

### Alternatives Considered

#### 1. Regular Expressions
- **Pros**: Simple, lightweight, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Cannot handle nested structures, fails on malformed HTML, security risks with complex patterns

#### 2. jsdom
- **Pros**: Full DOM implementation, comprehensive API
- **Cons**: Heavy dependency (~2MB), includes unnecessary browser APIs, performance overhead

#### 3. node-html-parser
- **Pros**: Fast, lightweight, good performance
- **Cons**: Less spec-compliant, limited error handling for malformed HTML

#### 4. parse5 (Selected)
- **Pros**: 
  - HTML5 specification compliant
  - Lightweight and focused solely on parsing
  - Excellent security track record
  - Handles malformed HTML gracefully
  - Active maintenance and wide adoption
- **Cons**: More verbose API compared to some alternatives

### Rationale

**parse5** was chosen because:

1. **Spec Compliance**: As an HTML5 spec-compliant parser, it handles edge cases and malformed HTML consistently
2. **Security Focus**: Proven track record in security-sensitive applications with proper input sanitization
3. **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint compared to full DOM implementations like jsdom
4. **Reliability**: Widely used in production by major projects, indicating stability and reliability
5. **Maintainability**: Active development and clear API make it suitable for long-term maintenance

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Reliable HTML parsing, security benefits, spec compliance
- **Negative**: Slightly more complex API requires wrapping for our use case
- **Neutral**: Additional dependency, but justified by the reliability gains

### Implementation Notes

The parse5 integration will be abstracted behind our own parsing interface to maintain API flexibility and allow for future parser changes if needed.
