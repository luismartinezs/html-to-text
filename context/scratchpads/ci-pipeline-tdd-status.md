# CI Pipeline TDD Status

## Current Status: RED Phase ✅

All tests properly failing, ready for implementation.

## Test Coverage

### `/test/ci-workflow.test.ts` - 7 tests (all failing ❌)

1. **`should have workflow file`**
   - Tests: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Create workflow file

2. **`should be valid YAML`**
   - Tests: Workflow file parses as valid YAML
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Valid YAML syntax

3. **`should trigger on pull request events`**
   - Tests: `on: [pull_request]` trigger configuration
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: PR trigger setup

4. **`should have lint job`**
   - Tests: Job named `lint` with `bun run lint:scripts` command
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Lint job configuration

5. **`should have test job`**
   - Tests: Job named `test` with `bun test` command
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Test job configuration

6. **`should have build job`**
   - Tests: Job named `build` with `bun run build` command
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Build job configuration

7. **`should use correct Bun setup in all jobs`**
   - Tests: All jobs use `oven-sh/setup-bun` action
   - Status: ❌ File doesn't exist
   - Implementation needed: Bun setup in all jobs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Workflow Structure

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
- [ ] Create `ci.yml` file with basic structure
- [ ] Add `pull_request` trigger
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax

### Phase 2: Job Configuration

- [ ] Add lint job with Bun setup
- [ ] Add test job with Bun setup
- [ ] Add build job with Bun setup
- [ ] Add correct commands to each job

### Phase 3: Validation

- [ ] Run tests to verify all pass (GREEN phase)
- [ ] Test actual workflow in GitHub (manual verification)

## Dependencies Validated

- ✅ `bun run lint:scripts` - exists in package.json:21
- ✅ `bun test` - exists in package.json:19
- ✅ `bun run build` - exists in package.json:18
- ✅ `js-yaml` dependency - added for test parsing

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

- **CI runs automatically on PR creation/updates** → Tests 1,2,3
- **All stages (lint, test, build) pass** → Tests 4,5,6,7
- **Failed checks block PR merge** → GitHub branch protection (manual setup)

## Next Steps

Ready to implement `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to make tests pass.
