{scoped project}

# Planning Process
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining your approach to preparing the PRD.

# Context
- Output: A brief, structured PRD that captures the essential details of the project.
- Out of scope: Inclusion of marketing, sales pitches, or unrelated features.

# Planning and Verification
- Parse the scoped project input to extract key requirements.
- Summarize them in a skimmable PRD format.
- After drafting the PRD, briefly validate that each section is clear and that all essential project requirements are addressed. If clarification is needed, escalate before finalizing.

# Output Format
- Return the PRD in Markdown as appropriate.
- Structure should include: Objective, Features/Requirements, Success Criteria, and Constraints (if applicable).

# Verbosity
- Output should be brief, direct, and easy to scan.

# Stop Conditions
- Return once a PRD meeting these criteria is produced.
- Escalate or request clarification if the input is insufficient for a clear PRD.
